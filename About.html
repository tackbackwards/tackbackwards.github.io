This website is so I can write down random things somewhere that isn't sketcher united, I probably wont do anything here and the fact you are on this website
<br>
means you are the first to visit it, my youtube channel tackbackward is super dead but I still post there.
<br>
literally no one watches my videos anymore which is sad but I guess "I love tables" isn't that interesting of a title.
