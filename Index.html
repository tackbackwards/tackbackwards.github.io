The Lingo Show is a show for children to teach them languages and stuff but there was a game made for it,  
<br>
the game was removed some time after 2015 and the only thing that exists to prove that it was real is this youtube video
</p>

<p>
It doesn't come up when you search up "The Lingo Show" on youtube but if you search up "The Lingo Show Control" then it comes up with this video.
<br>
Honestly it is not that interesting but some people have been trying to find evidence that this existed and I just remembered it randomly just now.
